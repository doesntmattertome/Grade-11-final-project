This is my final project for the 11th grade in computer science (deeplearning).

In this project I tried to create a neural network that is able to detect regular playing cards(an ace to 5).
This repository contains:
The database used in the training and testing of the neural network, the "library" used to build the neural network(in the file: "DL3.py") and the graphical user interface that was used to both build the database and test the model in the real world. 

This [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j6y3EPRiFue48ZrQFcqP485CExZCYxSqJvUpXSlP32g/edit?usp=sharing) goes to the project's summary and process.
