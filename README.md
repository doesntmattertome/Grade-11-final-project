This is my final project in the deep-learning course for the 11th grade. 

In this project, I tried to create a neural network that can detect regular playing cards(from ace to 5).
This repository contains:
The database used in the training and testing of the neural network, the "library" used to build, train and test the neural network(in the file: "DL3.py") and the graphical user interface that was used to both build the database and test the model in the real world.
